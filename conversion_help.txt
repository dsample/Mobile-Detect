Converting the PHP regex to JSON using your favourite regex-capable text
editor.

There's a little markup to change from PHP variable definition to the
beginning of the JSON object, but after that you can pretty much use the
following regex in find & replace, and also remove any PHP comments that
might be in there.

Find: "('[a-zA-Z]+')\s+=> ('[^']+')(,?)"
Replace with: "  {\n    'category': \1,\n    'regex': \2\n  }\3"

Remember to check the last items in the array parts of the object that
it doesn't end with a comma.
